Project’s Title

356 Custom Restoring Frontend Project 

Project Description

My project delivers a fresh new design for the current 356 Custom Restoring website.
I used primarly HTML and CSS and a touch of JavaScript.

This was a project to learn the basics of HTML and CSS, using a Udemy course: Build Responsive Real-World Websites with HTML and CSS from Jonas Schmedtmann. 

In the course you build an fictional meal delivering service www.omnifood.dev , but I used the code lay out for my own project.

Challenges

Background Image

Since the Omnifood project does not use a background images for their website, I have to figured it out on my own.

Eacht section has it’s own Porsche background image, and I use Flexbox to do that.

With problems I asked the right quastions on chatgpt and watched a lot of YouTube. 

Media quaries

It was a challenge to code all the different media queries for desktop, tablets and phones. 
With the help of the Udemy course, chatgpt and YouTube I made a work the best I can. 
Because Google Chrome is the most used browser, I only focused on this type. 
It was possible to use BrowserStack, but I needed a paid subscription. Since it is a student project, I did not chose to use BrowserStack.
